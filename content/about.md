I assist software engineering teams as a Software and Site Reliability Engineer by designing and developing back-end systems, ensuring that applications and systems are reliable, scalable, available, and performant.

I'm a software engineer that has taken the role of a Site Reliability Engineer for a few years now. As an SRE, I led an effort to convert teams and on-call rotations to an alerting app called Opsgenie, I improved visibility in how applications deployed in AWS are scaling, I was the lead engineer in making sure our development teams that created new apps and features follow a production readiness review process, I helped manage our infrastructure in AWS by way of Terraform, Python, Gitlab, and Jenkins, and I automated a bunch of things. Lately, I've been diving into an am passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I've been known by my coworkers to be approachable, collaborative, thorough, able to bridge the gap between business requirements and technical challenges to deliver good solutions, and that I'm willing to learn. On the side, I'm a drummer for a reggae/hawaiian band and I'm working on being a bodybuilder.
